Yummy blocks is a physics based block game where colorful blocks fall and collide with each other. Blocks that are of the same color will be damaged when they touch each other and eventually be destroyed (depending on level). Every time 20 blocks are destroyed the level and difficulty will increase. The game is over when there are over 70 blocks on the screen.
