TODO:
1. Add game menu with Play, Instructions, Highscore and Quit button  
2. Make game over text pop up and ask for replay  
3. Add multiplayer support (local and online)  
4. Local multiplayer support can be over bluetooth or wifi  
5. Figure a way to monetize game, show ads when player is waiting for game in online mode?  
6. In game purchases: grant new ability for dual block types (blocks that have two colors) at the start of every level for 10 seconds. The dual block can be affected by two block types instead of one block type. There are four dual block types so their can be up to four purchases. There is also an optional purchase to remove ads when waiting in the lobby or for a game.  
7. Rename block_drop to something cooler like Colliding Cubes?
